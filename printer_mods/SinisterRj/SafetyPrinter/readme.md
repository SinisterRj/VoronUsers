# SafetyPrinter Mod
[Safety Printer](https://github.com/SinisterRj/SafetyPrinter) is a great project to improve the safety of your printer. The project aims to improve the safety of 3D FDM Printers by adding an external MCU which increases your chance of preventing or mitigating a fire at your home. This is done by adding an inexpensive Arduino with proper firmware, some sensors (such as redundant bed/hot end temperature sensors or smoke sensors) and a relay that allow this Arduino to shutdown your printer as soon something wrong start to happen, like, a higher temperature than normal or smoke. 

More information about the project can be found at:

This mod includes all 3D parts to be printed to assemble the Safety Printer MCU and its sensors to a Voron 2.4 printer.
